### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a BSCS student at FAST University, I'm deeply immersed in the world of web development, 
constantly honing my skills through courses like those offered on Udemy. 
My repertoire includes languages such as C++, C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with frameworks and tools like Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and PostgreSQL. 
My expertise extends to crafting robust RESTful APIs and implementing authentication and security measures to ensure data integrity and user privacy.
Currently, I'm passionately engaged in the development of a chat web application, leveraging my knowledge to create seamless and interactive user experiences.
